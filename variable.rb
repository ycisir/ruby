Variables in Ruby
=====================

5 types of variable in Ruby

1) Global variables -- start with $ sign, these variables have scope globally, throughout the application
2) Local variables -- start with lowecase alphabet or _(underscore), these variables have scope locally, in a method, or block of code or class defination
3) Class variables -- start with @@ sign, these have scope only in the class defined, outside the class they have no scope
4) Instance variables -- start with @ sign, these variables are used to create attributes on an object
5) CONSTANTS -- start with CAPITAL LETTER, these are also global variables, they mean that the value remains constant
